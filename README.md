# Factory-Information-Systems-Course-Assignment
Overview:
 Factory Information Systems (FIS) is utilized to help manufactures to optimize the production process
by analyzing the captured information from the entities within the system. This leads to decrease costs
of production and increase the quality of products.

Tools and environment:
- Fastory line simulator.
- Visual Paradigm: In this assignment the “Visual paradigm “software is used to display the 
- diagrams of components of the system based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
- MySQL: To make database to implement the project.
- Node.js: To implement monitoring the information of production line.
- Webstorm: to run and implement the JavaScript codes.
- Web browser: The UI for the system implemented.

Skills to be acquired and checked:
* Ability to use various data formats.
* Ability to implement parsers for selected data formats.
* Ability to design and implement information systems - from architecture to working components.
* Being able to work with information - delivering/processing it to/at the right entities in the system.


Task description

A factory makes mobile phones and sells those to the various customers, who are the distributers of OEMs, shops or even direct human customers (see the first lecture - trends for the OEMs). The factory has hired your company to implement the information system that would allow  dynamically to place new orders, know the status of the production line, what orders there are at this moment, what is the remaining time to finish each order. As you and the other (maximum) two partners have established the company delivering factory information systems solutions, you started to feel that life begins to smile at you. Thanks to this new project you are about to pay the housing loan and carry on following your road to the prosperity. 

Your success became possible due to the competitive advantage, which is the use of broadly used and proven web standards and latest platforms bringing the advantage of building scalable (easier to extend) systems that have a greater chance to serve for the longer time comparing to what was there before.

The factory production line consists of 12 workstations - 11 robot stations and one manual work station. The simulator of the system having similar interface is located at the following URL:

As the product carrier (the pallet) moves in the system. Different work stations make various components of a mobile phone - frame, screen and keyboard. As each of those components can come in three shapes and be of three colours, it gives in total 9 * 9 * 9 = 729 product variations that can be made by the factory. An order of a customer can contain different setups in terms of product variations and number of pieces ordered for each variation. 

The system you develop should translate the customer order into execution order at the production line and be aware on the status of the customer order as various pieces get competed by the production line.
